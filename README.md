Algorithm:
A set of instructions followed by a computer. VQE and PEA are types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.


Algorithm: A set of instructions used to solve a problem, especially by a computer. The instructions are created so that it can be understood by the computer. This is then sent to the quantum computer. The computer then follows the instructions using some program or software. The end of the process provides an answer or even many possible answers.

VQE and PEA are two types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.


VQE outline:
- Firstly, we start by preparing a state using a "special" method. This method makes it possible for the algorithm run in the way that we want.

- Secondly, we measure the total energy for each value of the distance. We must select the lowest value as we are focusing on the ground energy.

- After that, a tool is then used to find more lower values of the total energy.

- All steps are repeated until we reach the smallest value possible.
