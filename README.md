Algorithm:
A set of instructions followed by a computer. VQE and PEA are types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.


Algorithm: A set of instructions used to solve a problem, especially by a computer. The instructions are created so that it can be understood by the computer. This is then sent to the quantum computer. The computer then follows the instructions using some program or software. The end of the process provides an answer or even many possible answers.

VQE and PEA are two types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.
