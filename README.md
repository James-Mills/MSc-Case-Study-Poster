Algorithm: A set of instructions followed by a computer. VQE and PEA are types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.

Algorithm: A set of instructions used to solve a problem, especially by a computer. The instructions are created so that it can be understood by the computer. This is then sent to the quantum computer. The computer then follows the instructions using some program or software. The end of the process provides an answer or even many possible answers.

VQE and PEA are two types of algorithm which is performed by a special type of computer known as the quantum computer.

VQE outline:

Firstly, we start by preparing a state using a "special" method. This method makes it possible for the algorithm run in the way that we want.

Secondly, we measure the total energy for each value of the distance. We must select the lowest value as we are focusing on the ground energy.

After that, a tool is then used to find more lower values of the total energy.

All steps are repeated until we reach the smallest value possible.

PEA outline:

Similarly to the VQE algorithm, we must prepare a state using another "special" method since these are two different algorithms.
Next, some "magical" equipment must be set up in a superposition of states - this will make it possible to measure the state.
Then, we use some operations to set up the state and the apparatus so that it is ready to be measured.
Finally, we measure the state to find the lowest value of the total energy. We repeat this process until find an accurate value of the total energy.

Conclusion:
VQE was proven to work better than PEA because it gives more accurate results. Therefore, it is used more than PEA. Creating more algorithms such as VQE can lead to making new medicinces, materials and other cool applications!
